                        <p>We were walking down through Greenwich Village on a perfect Saturday morning, when Christine asked me why my palms were unusually sweaty. I'm usually quite proud of my ability to remain sweat-free even in anxious moments, but this one was different -- two minutes later we'd be engaged (at least I hoped). Luckily, I was able to conceal the rather bulbous box I'd stored in my inner jacket pocket. It contained what I hoped would be the perfect ring for Christine. As we wound through Washington Square Park, and then down MacDougal, Christine was going on about what her ideal apartment would look like and where it would be. Half listening, I had us make a right turn on Minetta Lane, and then a quick left onto lonely Minetta Street -- a path we'd taken so many times before, where Christine once pointed out the cafe where Dylan wrote Blowin in the Wind or the bars frequented by Kerouac & Burroughs. Now there'd be a new landmark on Minetta. As we walked just past the bend in the road, I got down on one knee and proposed. Luckily, handing Christine the box upside down didn't ruin the moment, as she confirmed that she too would like to share the rest of her life with me. We didn't know what to say for about 40 minutes, as we waddled around in circles on Minetta Lane, saying hi to passing tourists who could see in our faces that something great had just happened. They were right!</p>
